This project visualizes satellite coverage using position data and overlays the coverage heatmap on a world map of the oceans. The map is created using Natural Earth shapefiles.

## Features
- Generates a heatmap of satellite coverage based on position data.
- Overlays the heatmap on a world map of oceans from Natural Earth shapefiles.

## Requirements
